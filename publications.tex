\small\sffamily{Traceability is establishing link between software requirement documentation and source code. The existing approaches for traceability applied natural language text mining algorithms on the code base, overlooking the fact that source code is an abstract form. We reduced the semantic distance between source code and requirement by expanding the abstract syntax tree of Java programs with jdk documentation that increased the precision of recovering traceability links by 9\% on average}

\small\sffamily{In the past decade, there have been many well-publicized cases of source code leaking from different well-known companies. We proposed a solution of detecting sensitive information, automatically refactoring them without significantly losing code comprehensibility.}
